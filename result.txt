Query: How does AI relate to machine learning and deep learning?

Reasoning: Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks to learn from data. Neural networks are a type of artificial neural network, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

    Let me now provide my final answer: Machine learning is the field of study that focuses on developing computer systems that can learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms use data to make predictions or decisions, and can be applied to a variety of tasks such as classification, regression, and reinforcement learning.
